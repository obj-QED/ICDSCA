### 2. Your cookie choices & how to opt-out

You have the choice whether to accept the use of cookies and, we have explained how you can exercise your rights below.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept HTTP Cookies. The “help” feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies and, how to disable existing cookies. For more information about HTTP cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/](http://allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/).
We are not responsible for the effectiveness of any such opt-out options.  California residents may be entitled to know the effects of opt-out options under California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b)(7). The effect of an opt-out, if successful, will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g., research, analytics and internal Site operation purposes).

Controlling the HTML5 local storage on your browser depends on which browser you use. For more information regarding your specific browser please consult the browser’s website (often in the Help section).

Please note, however, that without HTTP cookies and HTML5 local storage, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Site features and, some parts of the Site may not function properly.
